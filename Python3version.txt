====== Python3version ======

Currently PyTaskExec scripts only work when Python 2.7. Even though can invoke the TaskDbBuilder and ExecRun using python3, the python executable is /usr/bin/python. 

In the future this will have to be fixed. One of the problems that will arise is that unicode is not a specified type in Python3, and one will have to accomodate the fact that in Python3, str replaces unicode and bytes replaces str.
